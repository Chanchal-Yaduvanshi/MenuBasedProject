## üåü Automated Menu-Driven Application

Welcome to the **Automated Menu-Driven Application** repository! This project was developed as part of my summer internship at LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd. The goal was to create a versatile, user-friendly application that integrates multiple technologies to automate a variety of tasks.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive and automated solution for managing tasks related to cloud services, containerization, and scripting. The application is designed to simplify complex operations by offering a streamlined, menu-driven interface.

---

## üíª Technologies Implemented

- **AWS:** Automated cloud operations like IAM user creation, EC2 instance management, S3 bucket handling, and SNS services.
- **Docker:** Implemented containerization to ensure consistent environments across different stages of deployment.
- **Python:** Developed scripts for various functionalities such as sending SMS, fetching geo-coordinates, and more.
- **CGI-BIN:** Used CGI scripts to build a robust backend that ensures seamless interaction between the user and the application.
- **Frontend:** Designed a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy navigation of the menu.

## üåü Project Highlights

- **AWS Automation:** Simplified tasks such as "Create IAM User," "Launch Instance," "Get Instance Log," and "Manage S3 Bucket."
- **Docker Automation:** Integrated Docker operations directly into the menu for efficient container management.
- **Python-Powered Tasks:** Easily accessible functions like "SMS through Python," "Get Geo Coordinates," and "Send Email."
